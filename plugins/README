DebWrt plugins support

Layout:

  plugins/<plugin-name>/           - plugin directory
  plugins/<plugin-name>/README     - information about the plugin
  plugins/<plugin-name>/plugin.mk  - included as a Makefile by plugins.mk
  plugins/<plugin-name>/debwrt     - debwrt patches
  plugins/<plugin-name>/openwrt    - openwrt patches

All plugins are enabled by default and all patches part of the plugin will be
applied to DebWrt and OpenWrt. Use the make <target> PLUGIN=<plugin-name> to 
only apply one plugin.

The DebWrt patches are automatically applied in `sort`-ed order before 
make (menu)config.

OpenWrt patches are applied at the same time as DebWrt's patches to OpenWrt.
Patches can be target at specific branches or ranges of revision based on
filename.  Refer to openwrt/patches/README for imformation on the process.
Note patches MUST follow the rules in openwrt/patches/README as otherwise they
will not be applied!

plugin.mk is included by the plugins.mk Makefile.  See
plugins/example/plugin.mk.example for an example.  Note most rules will require
$(PLUGIN_ID) to be copied into a pattern-specific variable.


Make targets to manage plugings. Normally only needed when developing a plugin. Targets:

  make plugins/apply   - Apply debwrt patches and show message openwrt patches are done later
  make plugins/remove  - Remove debwrt patches
  make plugins/clean   - Clean up apply and de-apply states
