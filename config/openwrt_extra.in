config OPENWRT_DOWNLOAD_DIR
	string "OpenWrt alternate download directory"
	help
	  When checking out and building multiple revisions of OpenWrt it
	  comes in handy to not download all required external sources over
	  and over again, but save them in one directory. If this directory
	  exists, during checkout, a symlink will be created to it from
	  the build directory of the checked out revision.  Be aware that
	  if you use a relative directory here, it must be relative to
	  "build/openwrt-<board>-<revision>-<kernel>" and not to "."

config OPENWRT_MAKE_OPTIONS

    default ""
    help
      Add make command line options to OpenWrt. For example -j 3. Note -j does 
      not seem to work for OpenWrt.
