          Auto discover root device, optionally kexec to a alternate kernel and boot from this device.
          .
	  Normally DebWrt boots directly from the root= device. With this option enabled, DebWrt boots initially
          from /dev/mtdblock2 and runs an alternate boot script (/etc/preinit). This scripts discovers block
          devices and will look for a device with a label of DEBWRT_ROOT or fall back to /dev/sda1. And mounts it.
          .
          Next it will kexec to /boot/vmlinux.elf if it exits on the DEBWRT_ROOT device. 
          .
          After mounting ( or kexec ), a pivot_root to the DEBWRT_ROOT device is done and /sbin/init is executed.

	  Override OpenWrt default kernel command line. Tell the kernel to boot from /dev/sda1,
	  an USB storage device. Rootdelay is specified, to give the USB storage/SCSI driver
   	  to become ready, before the kernel tries to boot from it.
